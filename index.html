        <h1>installer.sh</h1>

<p>Write your own installation script!</p>

<h2>What is installer.sh for?</h2>

<p>I'm tired of downloading tarballs, extracting them and running commands like
<code>./configure</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>make install</code> ... many many times. Definitely developers
know where to download the tarballs from, how to build the softwares and how to
install them. They should write the script to automate installation.</p>

<p>installer.sh makes it easy to write scripts automating installation. You can
automate installion of your great softwares or some other useful softwares by
defining a few variables and a function in installer.sh.</p>

<p>installer.sh is strongly inspired by <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">ArchLinux</a>'s
makepkg and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Creating_Packages">PKGBUILD</a>.</p>

<h2>Things installer.sh does not do</h2>

<p>installer.sh is not a package manager. It does not:</p>

<ul>
<li>manage installed packages</li>
<li>record installed files (and uninstall packages by removing these files)</li>
<li>update packages automatically</li>
</ul><p>Users who want to install softwares should not use installer.sh when the
softwares are provided by package managers. This script is for softwares which
are not so popular, or not updated to newer version on some systems.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>installer.sh is not intended to install. Use this script as a template and write
commands as you need!</p>

<h2>Defining a package</h2>

<p>Define some variables and functions.</p>

<h3>$pkgname</h3>

<p>Name of package.</p>

<h3>$source (if needed)</h3>

<p>Newline separated list of urls of archives. Archive listed here will be
downloaded and extracted automatically. If the archives already exist, do
not download them twice.</p>

<p>Each line is just the url to download archives or can be like
<code>$pkgname-$pkgver.tar.gz::http://example.com/file.tar.gz</code>. In this form, you can
change the name of downloaded archive.</p>

<p>Each Downloaded file is extracted immediately in $srcdir If it has a archive
 suffix.</p>

<h3>$pkgver (optional)</h3>

<p>Version of the software.</p>

<h3>$pkgdesc (optional)</h3>

<p>Short description.</p>

<h3>$url (optional)</h3>

<p>Url of the software.</p>

<h3>main()</h3>

<p>Function called when installing package.</p>

<p>Before functions are called, archives listed in <code>$sources</code> were downloaded and
extracted, and <code>$startdir</code> and <code>$srcdir</code> were set. <code>$startdir</code> is the working
directory when install.sh was executed and <code>$srcdir</code> is directory where
downloaded archive files are extracted. Usually you can use a command like
<code>cd $srcdir/$pkgname-$pkgver</code> to go into the directory the files were
extracted.</p>

<h3>help_main() (optional)</h3>

<p>Additional help descripting options of <code>main()</code>.</p>

<h2>Execute installer.sh</h2>

<p>To install the package, run:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./installer.sh install
</code></pre>

<p>Only download archive listed in $source and extract them by following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./installer.sh fetch
</code></pre>

<p>This command is especially useful when you are writing <code>main()</code> or you want
to issue some commands before install.</p>
